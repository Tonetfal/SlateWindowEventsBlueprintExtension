# Slate Window Events Blueprints Extension

This plugin exposes some Slate window events to the blueprints.

## Installation

Download the release that you wish to use from the
[Release](https://github.com/Tonetfal/SlateWindowEventsBlueprintExtension/releases) page, and copy its Plugins directory
into your project's root.

## Usage

So far, it only exposes one event, but it might grow as my personal needs grow.
